Model training : Train an XGBOOST model using the training data.XGBOOST is an efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting for regression and classification problem.
Hyperparameter Tuning : Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the XGBOOST model using techniques like grid search and random search to improve its performance.
Model Evaluation : Evaluate the trained XGBOOST model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error(MAE),Mean Square Error(MSE), and Root Mean Square Error(RMSE).
